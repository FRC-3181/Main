4 Talon Crap-out:
Problem:
Talons work individually, but when four are initialized, they all run very briefly and then suddenly stop regardless of what value is sent to them
Tests:
Initialize 4 Talons, don't set speed (Fails)
Initialize 4 Talons, set speed to 0.25 (Fails)
Initialize 2 Talons and set speed, wait 2 seconds, then Initialize other 2 and set speeds (works until second set of Talons initialized)
Replace Digital SideCar Cable and run previous test again (Same results)
Replace Digital SideCar and run same test (Same Results)
Wait a few seconds after initializing with each Talon (works until last Talon initialized)
Reverse order of Talon initialization (same results)
